  "description": "Dowon, a famously known psychoanalyst in the United States, returns to Korea to work as a counselor at a research institution affiliated with the government agency, where he encounters an arsonist who’s infamously known for never leaving behind a trace. MJ, a man suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and unable to control his urges, asks Dowon to cure his illness. Eventually, Dowon accepts this secret and dangerous counseling, only to later find out that the man he thought was just an arsonist is revealed to be related to a “major incident” and becomes involved in the so-called “Father” case.",
